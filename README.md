This is my first time doing the AoC challenge!

You can check out the description of all the problems here: https://adventofcode.com/2025

### My choice of programming languages

As I (currently) only know Python and Java, those languages are the ones I will be doing all the challenges in this year. 
* Odd days (1, 3, 5, ...) $\to$ <strong> Python </strong>
* Even days (2, 4, 6, ...) $\to$ <strong> Java </strong>

Hopefully I will be able to do the challenge everyday!
